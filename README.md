# Python-InstacartAnalysis
This is a presentation that I created for Instacart to show the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors.

# Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart would like exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Key Questions
- What are the busiest day of the week and hours of the day?
- Are particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Are there simpler price range groupings to help direct marketing efforts?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? 
- What are the different types of customers in the system and how are their ordering behaviors differ based on the following:
  - Distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty
  - Differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status
  - Differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region
  - Connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits
  - Different classifications in demographic information suggest: Age, Income, Certain types of goods, and Family status
  - Differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles: Price of orders, Frequency of orders, and Products customers are ordering
